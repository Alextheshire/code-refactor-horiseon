# Code Refactor for Horiseon
## I have refactored the code for Horiseon's website to improve the quality of the baseline code.  I have added semantic html tags for increased accessibility and search engine optimization.  I have updated the CSS to make it more concise, and added comments to help clarify what every rule does.
